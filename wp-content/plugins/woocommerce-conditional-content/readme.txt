Create reusable pieces of content and display those on your store based on a set of criteria that you define.  
Choose where content is displayed by choosing from a set of template locations or enter your own.  
A template tag is provided for manual output into a theme. 

Conditional content is designed to allow you to display messages, advertisements, reminders, or other content based on several configurable rules that you setup. 
Conditional content works as an excellent companion to Dynamic Pricing, allowing you to display pricing tables when the criteria you configure has been met. 
Conditional content also works great as an up-selling and cross-selling tool, works great to help you promote sales by displaying messages on products which a sale is about to expire. 


The types of rules that you can configure are:
Products
	Specific Products
	Product Types
	Product in Categories
	Products with Attributes
	Product Price Range 
Stock
	Stock Status
	Stock Level Range
	Sales
	Sale Start and End dates
	Sale Status
Membership
	Specific Roles
	Specific Users
Cart
	Cart Total
	Cart Products
	Categories of Products in Cart

A flexible API allows a developer to create and configure custom rules and processing types.
