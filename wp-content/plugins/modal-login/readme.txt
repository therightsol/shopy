======== DESCRIPTION ========
Modal Log-in for WordPress provides you with a beautiful alternative log-in for your WordPress powered website based on the popular Twitter Boostrap.

When creating our popular White Label Branding for WordPress our idea was never to hide the fact the website is powered by WordPress. We firmly believe that it is a positive thing that your website is built using WordPress. However we received a lot of feedback from customers asking for an alternative to the normal WordPress plugin and also a way to hide the wp-login.php and wp-admin for increased security. And also for not obviously giving away that the website is powered by WordPress.

With this in mind we have created Modal Log-in for WordPress, which is a powerful plugin that lets you easily create stunning looking Log-in, Log-out, Register, Lost your password and Maintenance message for your WordPress powered website.

The editor works perfectly in all modern browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE 10. The final result (login screen) will also work in older browsers like IE7, IE8 and IE9.

We hope you will like it!


The Main Features:

* Replace the default WordPress login with Twitter Boostrap powered Modal Login
* Log In, Log Out, Lost Your Password and Register all integrated in Modal Login
* Set Redirect after login by User Role
* Enable Maintenance Screen feature
* Enable Forced Login
* Optional re-write of .htaccess allowing to block access to wp-login.php and wp-admin and set alternate login URL's.
* Troubleshooting and Debug mode for faster and easier support.
* Set Panic Key (optional). If login screen is broken you can skip the Modal Log-in by using the Panic Key

== INSTALLATION ==
